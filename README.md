# Hello-World
My hello world project

Hello all, my name is SÃ©rgio, I'm from Portugal and I don't have any formation in programming. My goal is to develop some skills related with C language and later, probably, Java. I intend to use programation in my profession or related (financial controller) and/or some web content.
