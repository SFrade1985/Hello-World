# Hello-World
## My hello world project

Hello all, my name is SÃ©rgio, I'm from Portugal and I've been studing python, since July'18. I've been learning data science since December'18. I'm a financial controller and my background is in the audit and financial controller. My goal is to develop my actual function to what I understand as *Financial controller 2.0*

Let's see what happens!
